    <h1>Netflix App - Router</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a Router to navigate to a ShowDetail component</li>
      <li>
        Create ShowDetail component that receives from route parameter the ID and fetch all the informations (from omdb
        & comments too)
      </li>
      <li>Change every Show (Movie or Series) to be clickable and to redirect to the ShowDetail component</li>
      <li>
        Make it so that every page component receives its title from the App component as a prop and use it in an "h1".
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>EXTRA</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a Link for TV Shows in the Navbar to navigate to a TV Shows component that you create.</li>
      <li>
        Pass a route parameter named "series" with the TV Shows component route and use it for querying APIs like:
        ?s={series}&type={series}.
      </li>
      <li>Display results accordingly</li>
      <li>Link every show in the result with the detail page</li>
      <li>Add loaders / empty states</li>
    </ul>
